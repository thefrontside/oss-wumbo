# What is this?

To learn what a project champion is, please read
[the readme](https://github.com/thefrontside/oss-wumbo/blob/master/README.md#what-is-a-project-champion).
The purpose of this file is to define who is championing what
project. This should give you a clear answer as to who to reach out to
and ask questions about the project.

**It's important to note if you don't see a project on this list, we're
most likely not planning on shipping anything for it.**
