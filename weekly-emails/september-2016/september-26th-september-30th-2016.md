## x-select

Not a lot happened last week for x-select, but what we did start our
`fs-branding` addon that will hold all of our shared styles for OS
addons. You can find
[that addon here](https://github.com/thefrontside/fs-branding). It's
very much a WIP right now.

With x-select there's a branch right now that consumes that addon to
provide styling to our x-select dummy app. This week I hope to wrap
that up and get started on rewriting the readme to reflect what
x-selects goal is today.
