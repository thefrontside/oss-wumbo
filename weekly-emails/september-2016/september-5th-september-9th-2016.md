The acceptance tests are passing, mirage is working, and the images are now being rendered using Faker. I'm debating what the next step is, perhaps that should be creating routes for the filters. We also need to have the hard conversation of what the data set will look like- how will we pull podcasts, blogs, and talks in?

I got the nested microstates working! I got the nested microstates working! The British are coming! I got the nested microstates working!

What this means will become clear since I'm signed up to give a lunch and learn on Friday on just what the hell microstates are at the low-level, but suffice it to say that it's a really huge blocker that got wiped off my plate. What remains now is to document it, merge it, and then open it up so that others can begin to add other core features like states for `Number`, `Bool`, `Date`, etc...

While I'm not going to commit to finishing my blog post on microstates, I will commit to finishing two of the tech-demos for the blog post and if all those things happen, then that will be enough!
