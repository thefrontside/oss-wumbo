The acceptance tests are passing, mirage is working, and the images are now being rendered using Faker. I'm debating what the next step is, perhaps that should be creating routes for the filters. We also need to have the hard conversation of what the data set will look like- how will we pull podcasts, blogs, and talks in?

 Last week, I attended ElixirConf and stoked the flames of my relentless pursuit of having too many side-projects. While I was there, I also started working on a small library called `ChangeBuffer` that will hopefully serve as the future foundation of `x-form`.

 In the next few weeks I hope to hammer down the `ChangeBuffer` library and write out docs for `x-form`.
