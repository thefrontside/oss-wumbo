Hey everyone! I hope you had a great week last week. I ended up
taking the whole week off. Now feel recharged and ready to go
again.

Chris did a spike on creating a standalone form addon that
wraps `ember-changeset`.

_His goal for this week_ is to continue that spike by
looking at how to incorporate contextual components to create
self-validating form fields.

Alex's _goal for this week_ is to get 90% of the original test suite
passing.

Stephanie made progress on the home page and got the fonts issue
fixed. Also got the SVG background (color border).

_Her goal for this week_ is to finish out the home page for the next
frontside website.

I still did some OSS work while I was out last week. I started work on
the weekly mailer rails app that I've been wanting to build. Basically
whenever you merge a PR with the weekly email label, it will
trigger a webhook which will grab the markdown in that PR, parse it,
and then send it off in an email.

I also was able to start a list of repos we should trim up and get rid
of. You can track that
[issue here](https://github.com/thefrontside/oss-wumbo/issues/2).

_My goal for this week_ is to merge the readme for
oss-wumbo,
[get admin help to prune the dead repos](https://github.com/thefrontside/oss-wumbo/issues/2),
[get admin help to clean up our teams](https://github.com/thefrontside/oss-wumbo/issues/3),
and finish the weekly mailer rails app.

I hope everyone has a good week! Don't drink too much of that Vessel
cold brew ;)
