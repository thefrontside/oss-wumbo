What's up everyone! I hope your week is going well.

Alex got middleman 4 working with ember islands last week, which is
pretty awesome! He also wrote the first integration tests for
`emberx-form` and got that merged in.

Stephanie was unblocked by Alex's work on middleman 4 and got the new
website master branch up to date so people can start picking tickets
up. Her goal for this week is to finish off the home page styling & work
with Jeffery on building subpages out.

Chris worked on building `emberx-form` and started dogfooding it
through one of our clients projects.This week he plans on open
sourcing `emberx-form`! :party-parrot:

Welcome to the team Jeffery! For his first week it looks like Jeffery
will be working on the new website with Stephanie.

Charles setup a hangouts call last week for those interested in where
`ember-microstates` is going. That did happen this week!

He also wants to write a README up for `ember-microstates` so others
who stumble across the project know what the project is and how they
can contribute.

For me last week I was scattered across a lot of different projects
with no real focus. I did merge the first pass at defining what
`oss-wumbo` is, which feels good. I said I was going to work on
x-select v3.0 but I didn't.

This week I NEED to cut a release of emberx-file-input which means I
have to address the last two issues that have popped up
recently. After that I want to focus on getting the website up and off
the ground with the right CSS "architecture". Also need to find time
to finish off any Ember-ATX coordination that I'm responsible for.

Thanks everyone!
