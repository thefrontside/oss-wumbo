# What is oss-wumbo?

oss-wumbo is a public repo The Frontside uses to interface with the
public at a meta level. The purpose of this repo is for you to gain a
deeper understanding of what open source projects we're currently
working on at The Frontside.

Our goal is if it pertains to open source we should be working in the
open and documenting our direction. This is so the users of our
software can have insight into what is next for the project they're
relying on. We're always looking for ways to improve how we
collaborate with the community.  If the users want to, they can
provide feedback and have an impact on our process or projects.


## What is a project champion?

A project champion is a person who is the main manager of an open
source repo. This person will have the most context of the project and
documents the roadmap of the project. This does not mean they do all
the work.

Some of the responsibilities for being a project champion are:

- Keeping the project up to date (managing dependecies, not letting
PRs get stale, etc)
- Managing & replying to issues
- Assigning PRs for review
- Setting release milestones
- Publishing the roadmap
- Keeping the project in what we deem good standing health (TODO, link
to this defenition)

Being a project champion means managing the code is only half of the
battle. You're managing a small community that uses your project with
it. You also fill a support role for people who need help using the
project. It's very important to foster this community!
